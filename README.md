# Separatwins
This is a really stupid site that lets you upload some images and then combines them to look similar to the
"separated at birth" images of Dagbladet and others. ([example](https://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/skilt-ved-fodselen/60164334))

I mainly built this to get some experience with Typescript and deploying with firebase.
